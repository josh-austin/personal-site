Yeshua the Messiah has really changed my life.  He has atoned for my sins and is working within me to reflect His perfect love.  He has also given me a knack for wanting to know how things work, which has led to my interest in web development and other forms of computer geekery.  One of my main goals in life is to share with the Jewish people the love that the Messiah has shown to me, regardless of if they will ever believe in their Messiah.

I really wouldn't mind living in Israel someday, and I especially wouldn't mind considering Israeli citizenship if the opportunity presents itself.
