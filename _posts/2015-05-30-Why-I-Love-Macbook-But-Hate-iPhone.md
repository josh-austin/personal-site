title: Why I Love Macbook But Dislike iPhone
---

This March I purchased a MacBook Pro 13" and replaced my 1st Generation Moto X with a shiny iPhone 6.  Within 2 months I put my iPhone 6 on eBay and bought a 2nd Generation Moto X.  Why?  Mainly because I prefer the Android operating system and the Moto X's low-power notification screen display.

As a computer geek, I strongly prefer the customizability of Android.  To be fair, if you are seeking an easy-to-use interface then iOS may be a better fit for you.  Additionally I found that I preferred the Moto X's availability of voice activation on battery over needing to push down the iPhone button to talk to Siri.  Speaking of the button, I also like the Moto X's display of notifications when waving my hand over it or pulling it out of my pocket.  I know much faster if a notification is important or not because I don't have to push a button.

My MacBook Pro 13", on the other hand, is the best laptop I've had so far.  The OS is Unix-like, which is very helpful for some of my web development, the touch pad and keyboard feel "natural" to me, and, despite being a little on the gimmicky side of marketing (did I invent a new word?), the Retina display is definitely sharp.

All in all, I am glad I got my MacBook Pro and I was glad to try out the iPhone and learn the hard way why I like the Moto X so much.
